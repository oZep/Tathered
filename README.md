I only started learning pygame 1 week ago from the start date of the jam, so it's a nice challenge to use it for a game jam

## Description

>Hey, did you end up taking a look at the cats' diet? Ever since we gave them that new brand of canned catnip, they've been very particular with their fur. It's causing their hairballs to be especially thick and heavy. It's honestly really disgusting. Bob already quit because of it.

>Oh, you're already working on a new project? With those two mice that the boss explicitly said not to tamper with or let out? What are you even doing with them?
>
>.............

>Jeez... mouse experiments just get weirder and weirder.
>
>You said you wanted to test their intelligence? Huh, okay, sure. I'll just write that down and hope the board approves.
>
>Oh? It's already in motion. Great. Well, I guess I can't stop you. Be sure to watch them closely, as much as I don't like you I don't want boss to fire you. Imagine running this place all on my own? I would go completely insane.
